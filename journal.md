today I came up with the idea to make a Racing game like iracing arcade although with much less polish. i got started on this and i am now debugging a bug where the car falls and then it starts swaying so i try to get this done.

time spent: 53min

I got started on fixing the car movements but i dont know if i will be able to fix it for now, and i am also working on making the first track and i spent too much time on it and it doesn't even work properly, so i chose to make it in godot it self which will be a challenge but that is ok.

total time spent up to date: 2h 27min
